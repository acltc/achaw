                                <p>
                                    Technical Leads serve as mentors and leaders for our volunteer developer apprentices. Typically, a group of eight apprentices will work on a client facing project with one or two technical leads providing guidance and experience. The technical leads provide technical guidance and direction to the project as a whole, making architecture decisions, and providing feedback through pair programming and code reviews.
